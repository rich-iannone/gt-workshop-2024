For this code-along we are going to make a complete table using the
`coffee_sales` dataset. Though there are lots of datasets available in the gt
package, this is not one of them. We'll import the data as a tibble object.

But before doing that, we need to ensure that gt and tidyverse is loaded via
`library()`:

```{r}
library(gt)
library(tidyverse)
```
