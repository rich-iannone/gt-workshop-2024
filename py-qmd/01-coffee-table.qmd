For this code-along we are going to make a complete table using the `coffee_sales` dataset. Though there are lots of datasets available in the Great Tables package, this is not one of them. We'll import the data as a CSV (TODO: currently it's a JSON file) using Polars first.

But before doing that, we need to import a few things from both Polars and Great Tables:

```{python}
import polars as pl
import polars.selectors as cs
from great_tables import GT, loc, style
```

Now let's read in the data from the file and inspect the Polars DataFrame: 

```{python}
coffee_sales = pl.DataFrame.deserialize("../data/coffee-sales.json", format="json")

coffee_sales
```

The first thing to do is to introduce the DataFrame to the `GT()` class:

```{python}
(
    GT(coffee_sales)
)
```
